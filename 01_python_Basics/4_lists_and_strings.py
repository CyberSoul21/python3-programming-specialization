#Lists################################################

#A list is a sequential collection of Python data 
#values, where each value is identified by an index. 
#The values that make up a list are called its elements. 
#Lists are similar to strings, which are ordered collections 
#of characters, except that the elements of a list can 
#have any type and for any one list, the items can be 
#of different types.

[10, 20, 30, 40]
["spam", "bungee", "swallow"]

["hello", 2.0, 5, [10, 20]]

#Tuples################################################

#A tuple, like a list, is a sequence of items of any type.
#The printed representation of a tuple is a 
#comma-separated sequence of values, enclosed in 
#parentheses. In other words, the representation is 
#just like lists, except with parentheses () instead of 
#square brackets [].

#The key difference between lists and tuples is that a 
#tuple is immutable, meaning that its contents canâ€™t be 
#changed after the tuple is created. We will examine the 
#mutability of lists in detail in the chapter on Mutability.

#Splitting and Joining Strings #######################################

#Two of the most useful methods on strings involve 
#lists of strings. The split method breaks a string 
#into a list of words. By default, any number of 
#whitespace characters is considered a word boundary.

song = "The rain in Spain..."
wds = song.split()
print(wds)


song = "The rain in Spain..."
wds = song.split('ai')
print(wds)

#The inverse of the split method is join. You choose 
#a desired separator string, (often called the glue) 
#and join the list with the glue between each of the 
#elements.

wds = ["red", "blue", "green"]
glue = ';'
s = glue.join(wds)
print(s)
print(wds)

print("***".join(wds))
print("".join(wds))

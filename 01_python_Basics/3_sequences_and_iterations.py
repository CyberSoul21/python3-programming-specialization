#So far we have seen built-in types like: int, float, and str. int and float are considered to be simple or primitive or atomic data types because their values are not composed of any smaller parts. They cannot be broken down.

#On the other hand, strings and lists are different from the others because they are made up of smaller pieces. In the case of strings, they are made up of smaller strings each containing one character.

#Types that are comprised of smaller pieces are called collection data types. Depending on what we are doing, we may want to treat a collection data type as a single entity (the whole), or we may want to access its parts. This ambiguity is useful.
